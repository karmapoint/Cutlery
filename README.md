# Cutlery - Browser-based Javascript card game based on SET

## Background

Set is an award-winning pattern recognition card game where players try to identify "sets" of three cards that meet a set of rules. Cutlery will utilize the basic premise of the game and create a version that is easy to play on web browsers (and hopefully tablets as well).

The deck is comprised of 81 unique cards that have four attributes:

 * Shape (fork, spoon, knife)
 * Color (red, yellow, blue)
 * Shading (solid, outline, pattern)
 * Number (one, two, three)

 Game play involves shuffling the deck and dealing out 12 cards. The player will need to select three cards that they feel make up a "set" into the three target slots on the side of the screen. A set requires that the three cards meet one of the following conditions:

 * All the same, or all different for shape.
 * All the same, or all different for color.
 * All the same, or all different for shading.
 * All the same, or all different for number.

The player will have a timer counting down from 1 minute to find a set. If they do this successfully, the selected cards are removed and three more are added to the board to replace them and the counter resets.  A score will tally how many sets they are able to make.

Should no sets be visible on the board, the cards will automatically be shuffled and restarted.

## Functionality & MVP

The set of initial features for this minimum viable product include the following:

* Users can drag and drop cards to the target area of the screen to identify a set.
* A timer will provide a sense of urgency to the game play. A bonus feature may involve creating levels where the duration of the timer is shortened each time.
* A quick tutorial will introduce the rules of the game. Another bonus feature would be an "easy" mode where there are only 9 cards visible, but all of them are solid colors to make it easier to spot. After finding two sets, users would be directed to the main game play.

* A production readme will describe the creation process and coding decisions.
